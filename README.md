## Gameplay

Blade Runner is an Endless-Runner game with a slight twist. The player’s goal is to navigate through the city, while sustaining his gradually decreasing power-charge. In order to achieve that, he has multiple different tasks to fulfill. 

One being, avoiding collision with obstacles, using the actions: 

	1. Move Left & Right
	2. Jump

The second being, cutting close objects to charge his power. The amount of charge will depend on the hits one manages to land. 





## Controls
