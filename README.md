## Gameplay

Blade Runner is a traditional endless-runner game. The player’s goal is to navigate through the city, while sustaining his gradually decreasing power-charge. In order to achieve this, he has multiple different tasks to fulfill. 

One being, avoiding collision with obstacles, using the actions: 

1. Move Left & Right
2. Jump

The second being, cutting close objects to charge his power. The amount of charge will depend on the hits one manages to land.
